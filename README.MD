The Bank Account Using Object-Oriented Principles, simulate a basic current account.

### A bank account have the following functionality

* Open Account
* Close Account 
* Display Balance
* Deposit Funds
* Withdraw Funds
* Apply agreed overdraft (Where an account is allowed to go into a pre-arranged negative balance) 

> NOTE: We prefer to use yarn over npm for a number of reasons. But mainly because it is much faster and much less issues.

### Getting Started

1.) The *requirements.txt* is not really necessary so you don't have to `pip install` or create a virtual environment.

2.) Navigate to the project directory:

`cd BankAccount---Exam`

### Running the Project

1.) Navigate to the project directory and run test for all unit test:

`python -m unittest`

2.) If you want to test a specific file:

`python -m unittest ${filename.py}`

`$ yarn start`

> Note:
> You're able to tweak some tests (for example, changing the inputs to analyse the outcome of said changes) without touching the implementation code.
